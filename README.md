## Gotchas

A few things to be aware of when using this extension:

- False positives/negatives are possible.
  - For example, in an HTML file if you use an `image` tag with the `height` attribute,
    the extension will currently detect the `height` attribute as a physical property.
  - Double check your file after using the `replace all` feature.
- Changing a physical property to a logical property may or may not have an effect on styles that override styles from other files and third-party files.

## Known Issues

Limited testing of this extension has been done.
