      | css* | less | sass | scss | stylus |
      | html** | markdown |
      | coffeescript | javascript | typescript |
      | javascriptreact (jsx) | typescriptreact (tsx) | vue | vue-html |
      | php |
      | plaintext |
      | xml | xsl |

  - \* Thousands of integration tests have been generated and run for `.css` files.
  - ** A limited amount of manual testing has been done on `.html` files.

<br />

## Breaking Changes

v0.1+ --> v0.2
The way that physical properties are detected has changed.  The extension is now using `stylelint` and `css-tree` to detect properties.  Currently only CSS and HTML are supported.  Previously regular expressions were used and more file types were supported but more error prone.

## Gotchas

A few things to be aware of when using this extension:

- False positives/negatives are possible.
  - For example, in an HTML file if you use an `image` tag with the `height` attribute,
    the extension will currently detect the `height` attribute as a physical property.
  - Double check your file after using the `replace all` feature.
- Changing a physical property to a logical property may or may not have an effect on styles that override styles from other files and third-party files.

<br />

## Known Issues

- Currently the extension is using a `stylelint` and `css-tree` to find potential physical properties.
  - This is a breaking change from the 0.1 version that used a `"naive"` approach (a simple regular expression to find potential physical properties).
  - Physical property values can be quite complex and difficult to detect and as such these methods are not perfect and can result in false positives and negatives.
- Incomplete testing
